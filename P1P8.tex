    \\begin\{enumerate\}\
        \\item we will roll three different numbers, \\textit\{twice\} each?\
        \\item we will roll some number \\textit\{exactly\} 4 times?\

    \\begin\{enumerate\}\
        \\item Say we have our six numbers as xxyyzz. We have 6 choose three numbers for x, y and z. Then, there are 6! different ways of arranging the xyz numbers. However, each of the three pairs can be re-arranged in $2!$ different ways where the ordering is indistinguishable, hence $2!^3$ total arrangements yielding the same order.  \\\\ \\textbf\{Solution: $\\dfrac\{\\dfrac\{6! \{6 \\choose 3\}\}\{(2!)^3\}\}\{6^6\}$\}\
        \\item Let's call the four of a kind numbers X, and the other two numbers $Y_a$ and $Y_b$.  Say something like XXXYXY, or XXXXYY, etc. This yields 6 choose 4 total ways of arranging four Xs and two Ys. However, there are also six different options for X, and then 5 different options for each Y. Therefore, we must multiply $6 \\choose 4$ by six, and then by five for the first Y, and then by five for the second Y. This yields $\{6 \\choose 4\} \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 5$. However, these orderings do not take into account the case where $Y_a$=$Y_b$. For example, $11115_a5_b$ would be double counted along with $11115_b5_a$. Now, we must calculate the number of times there is a pair, and divide it by $2!$ to count the repeats. To identify this number we can employ a similar methodology that was used to find the total number. However, instead of there being 5 options for $Y_a$ and five options for $Y_b$, there are simply five options between them. Then, we divide by two. And we divide by the total options, $6^6$, to get the probability. This yields a final answer of: \\\\ \\textbf\{Solution: $\\dfrac\{\{6 \\choose 4\} \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 5 - \\dfrac\{\{6 \\choose 4\} \\times 6 \\times 5\}\{2!\}\}\{6^6\}$\}\
    \\end\{enumerate\}\
